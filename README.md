# Introduction
LoL Conqueror is a successor to the awesome [Championify](https://github.com/dustinblackman/Championify) app from Dustin Blackman.  The app continued to work for a while, but as of League Season 11 (pre-season) it no longer works.  This app is a humble attempt to fill the enourmous hole left by Dustin's brilliant Championify app.

Like Championify, LoL Conqueror will download item builds from many different popular websites and then import them into the game for you to use in-game.  Simple!

Since LoL Conqueror is an Electron app, Windows 10 and Mac OS are both supported.

## Features
* Supports Summoner's Rift and ARAM
* Choose which sources you want to download from
* Includes skill priorities
* Does not touch the item sets created by you or other programs

## Downloads
You can find the latest release [here](https://github.com/jisaacfriend/lol-conqueror/releases/latest).

## Ideas and Suggestions
LoL Conqueror can always be better!  If you have an idea for a feature, feel free to add an [issue](https://github.com/jisaacfriend/lol-conqueror/issues) and I will consider it for a future release!

## Donate
LoL Conqueror is free, open-source, made and maintained by me.  While I don't charge anything for the app, I never object if someone wants to buy me a cup of coffee or a beer!  If you would like to do so, hit me up on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/jisaacfriend).

## Contribute
If you find a bug, have a feature you'd like to see added, or anything else, feel free to [submit a pull request](https://github.com/jisaacfriend/lol-conqueror/pulls).  Any and all ideas, features, and fixes are welcome!
